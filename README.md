# hng_stage_one
A mobile application that prominently features my Slack identity.
- The HomePage displays my Slack profile image, below it is my Slack username.
- Under the username exists a button that says 'open Git Hub'.
- This button links directly to my GitHub profile where all my repositories, this one included can be found.
- Webview is the package that handles that behavior in-app.
- It is basically a flutter package that helps in the integration, display, and interaction of actual webpages and sites in a flutter application.
